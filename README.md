## Neo Development Environment

### Powered by [neovim](https://neovim.io) & [lazyvim](https://github.com/lazyvim/lazyvim)

### Intro

This config is actually an extension of the excellent lazyvim.org distro which i have modulated for my own purposes. It has most of the core power of lazyvim which includes:

- multiple web languages support
- preconfigured completion with snippets support
- git integration
- ui candy
- file explorer
- floating terminal
- lua dev support

### Major keybindings

`C-` ` toggle floating terminal

`C-t` open / switch to terminal window

`<leader>se` list all the relevant snippets in`ivy` view

`<leader>l` lazyvim window
